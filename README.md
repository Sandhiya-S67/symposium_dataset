# Product Summary Dataset

## Overview
This dataset is designed for product summarization and consists of detailed product descriptions. It is structured to assist with tasks like text summarization, feature extraction, and product analysis.

## Dataset Files
- **ðŸ“‚ product_summarize_dataset.csv** â€“ Original dataset containing detailed product descriptions.
- **ðŸ“‚ product_train.csv** â€“ 80% of the dataset used for training purposes.
- **ðŸ“‚ product_test.csv** â€“ 20% of the dataset used for testing purposes.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Text Cleaning**
   - Removed special characters, numbers, and irrelevant content.
   - Standardized text by converting it to lowercase.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Applied TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical representations.
   - Employed word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) for enhanced feature representation.

3. **Dataset Splitting**
   - The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing for model evaluation.

## Recommended Models
For supervised learning tasks such as regression and classification, consider the following models:

### Regression
- **Linear Regression** (ideal for predicting product prices or scores)
- **Random Forest Regressor** (robust for complex data relationships)
- **XGBoost Regressor** (recommended for performance optimization)

### Classification
- **Logistic Regression** (for binary or multi-class classification)
- **Random Forest Classifier** (highly effective with minimal tuning)
- **XGBoost Classifier** (excellent for high-dimensional data)

## Column Descriptions
| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| Product Description | Detailed textual data describing the product features. |
| Category | Product category assigned to the item. |
| Price | Product price information. |
| Summary | The summarized description generated for each product. |

## Usage
- The `product_summarize_dataset.csv` can be used for text summarization tasks or exploratory data analysis.
- The train-test datasets (`product_train.csv` and `product_test.csv`) are structured to facilitate machine learning model training and evaluation.

## Next Steps
- Enhance the summarization model using transformer models like BART or T5.
- Perform additional feature engineering using NLP techniques.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR.
